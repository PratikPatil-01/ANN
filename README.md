# ANN
#This a a Deep leaning project where ANN (Artificial Neural Network) is used to predict if a Customer Stays in the bank or not
#The task is carried about by using concept of the Neural Network which undergoes various conditions and provide the Output in the Output Nueron.
#The "ReLu" acivation function is used in the hidden layer because it is one of the best and "Sigmoid" activation is used in the Output layer because we are predicting a Binary    Classification where only 2 possibilities are there that are of Customers Stays or Leaves.
